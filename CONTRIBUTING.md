## Contribution Workflow

### Issues and Discussions

- Feel free to open issues for any reason as long as you make it clear what this issue is about: bug/feature/proposal/comment.
- For questions and general discussions, please do not open an issue, and instead create a discussion in the "Discussions" tab.
- Please spend a minimal amount of time giving due diligence to existing issues or discussions. Your topic might be a duplicate. If it is, please add your comment to the existing one.
- Please give your issue or discussion a meaningful title that will be clear for future users.
- The issue should clearly explain the reason for opening, the proposal if you have any, and any relevant technical information.
- For technical questions, please explain in detail what you were trying to do, provide an error message if applicable, and your versions of Trivy-Operator and your environment.

### Pull Requests

- Every Pull Request should have an associated Issue unless it is a trivial fix.
- Your PR is more likely to be accepted if it focuses on just one change.
- Describe what the PR does. There's no convention enforced, but please try to be concise and descriptive. Treat the PR description as a commit message. Titles that start with "fix"/"add"/"improve"/"remove" are good examples.
- There's no need to add or tag reviewers, if your PR is left unattended for too long, you can add a comment to bring it up to attention, optionally "@" mention one of the maintainers that was involved with the issue.
- If a reviewer commented on your code or asked for changes, please remember to mark the discussion as resolved after you address it and re-request a review.
- When addressing comments, try to fix each suggestion in a separate commit.
- Tests are not required at this point as Trivy-Operator is evolving fast, but if you can include tests that will be appreciated.

#### Conventional Commits
It is not that strict, but we use the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) in this repository.
Each commit message doesn't have to follow conventions as long as it is clear and descriptive since it will be squashed and merged.

## Set up your Development Environment

1. Install Go

   The project requires [Go 1.17][go-download] or later. We also assume that you're familiar with
   Go's [GOPATH workspace][go-code] convention, and have the appropriate environment variables set.
2. Get the source code:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:aquasecurity/trivy-operator.git
   cd trivy-operator
   ```
3. Access to a Kubernetes cluster. We assume that you're using a [KIND][kind] cluster. To create a single-node KIND
   cluster, run:

   ```
   kind create cluster
   ```

## Build Binaries

| Binary               | Image                                          | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `trivy-operator`     | `docker.io/aquasec/trivy-operator:dev`         | Trivy Operator                                                |

To build all Trivy-operator binary, run:

```
make
```

This uses the `go build` command and builds binaries in the `./bin` directory.

To build all Trivy-operator binary into Docker images, run:

```
make docker-build
```

To load Docker images into your KIND cluster, run:

```
kind load docker-image aquasec/trivy-operator:dev
```

## Run Tests

We generally require tests to be added for all, but the most trivial of changes. However, unit tests alone don't
provide guarantees about the behaviour of Trivy-operator. To verify that each Go module correctly interacts with its
collaborators, more coarse grained integration tests might be required.

### Run Unit Tests

To run all unit tests with code coverage enabled, run:

```
make unit-tests
```

To open the test coverage report in your web browser, run:

```
go tool cover -html=coverage.txt
```

### Run Integration Tests

The integration tests assumes that you have a working kubernetes cluster (e.g KIND cluster) and `KUBECONFIG` environment
variable is pointing to that cluster configuration file. For example:

```
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```

To open the test coverage report in your web browser, run:

```
go tool cover -html=itest/trivy-operator/coverage.txt
```

To run the integration tests for Trivy-operator Operator and view the coverage report, first do the
[prerequisite steps](#prerequisites), and then run:

```
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=trivy-system \
  OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES=default \
  OPERATOR_LOG_DEV_MODE=true \
  make itests-trivy-operator
go tool cover -html=itest/trivy-operator/coverage.txt
```

### Code Coverage

In the CI workflow, after running all tests, we do upload code coverage reports to [Codecov][codecov]. Codecov will
merge the reports automatically while maintaining the original upload context as explained
[here][codecov-merging-reports].

## Custom Resource Definitions

### Generate Code

Code generators are used a lot in the implementation of native Kubernetes resources, and we're using the very same
generators here for custom security resources. This project follows the patterns of
[k8s.io/sample-controller][k8s-sample-controller], which is a blueprint for many controllers built in Kubernetes itself.

The code generation starts with:

```
go mod vendor
export GOPATH="$(go env GOPATH)"
./hack/update-codegen.sh
```

In addition, there is a second script called `./hack/verify-codegen.sh`. This script calls the
`./hack/update-codegen.sh` script and checks whether anything changed, and then it terminates with a nonzero return
code if any of the generated files is not up-to-date. We're running it as a step in the CI workflow.

## Test Trivy Operator

You can deploy the operator in the `trivy-system` namespace and configure it to watch the `default` namespace.
In OLM terms such install mode is called *SingleNamespace*. The *SingleNamespace* mode is good to get started with a
basic development workflow. For other install modes see [Operator Multitenancy with OperatorGroups][olm-operator-groups].

### In cluster

1. Build the operator binary into the Docker image and load it from your host into KIND cluster nodes:
   ```
   make docker-build-trivy-operator && kind load docker-image aquasec/trivy-operator:dev
   ```
2. Create the `trivy-operator` Deployment in the `trivy-system` namespace to run the operator's container:
   ```
   kubectl create -k deploy/static
   ```

You can uninstall the operator with:

```
kubectl delete -k deploy/static
```

### Out of cluster

1. Deploy the operator in cluster:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deploy/static/trivy-operator.yaml
   ```
2. Scale the operator down to zero replicas:
   ```
   kubectl scale deployment trivy-operator \
     -n trivy-system \
     --replicas 0
   ```
3. Delete pending scan jobs with:
   ```
   kubectl delete jobs -n trivy-system --all
   ```
4. Run the main method of the operator program:
   ```
   OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=trivy-system \
     OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES=default \
     OPERATOR_LOG_DEV_MODE=true \
     OPERATOR_CIS_KUBERNETES_BENCHMARK_ENABLED=false \
     OPERATOR_VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_ENABLED=true \
     OPERATOR_VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_SCAN_ONLY_CURRENT_REVISIONS=false \
     OPERATOR_CONFIG_AUDIT_SCANNER_ENABLED=false \
     OPERATOR_CONFIG_AUDIT_SCANNER_SCAN_ONLY_CURRENT_REVISIONS=false \
     OPERATOR_CONFIG_AUDIT_SCANNER_BUILTIN=true \
     OPERATOR_VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_REPORT_TTL="" \
     OPERATOR_BATCH_DELETE_LIMIT=3 \
     OPERATOR_BATCH_DELETE_DELAY="30s" \
     go run cmd/trivy-operator/main.go
   ```

You can uninstall the operator with:

```
kubectl delete -f deploy/static/trivy-operator.yaml
```

## Update Static YAML Manifests

```
mkdir -p $TMPDIR/trivy-operator-helm-template
```

```
helm template trivy-operator ./deploy/helm \
  --namespace trivy-system --create-namespace \
  --set="targetNamespaces=default" \
  --set="managedBy=kubectl" \
  --output-dir=$TMPDIR/trivy-operator-helm-template
```

```
cp $TMPDIR/trivy-operator-helm-template/trivy-operator/templates/rbac.yaml deploy/static/02-trivy-operator.rbac.yaml
cp $TMPDIR/trivy-operator-helm-template/trivy-operator/templates/config.yaml deploy/static/03-trivy-operator.config.yaml
cp $TMPDIR/trivy-operator-helm-template/trivy-operator/templates/deployment.yaml deploy/static/04-starboard-operator.deployment.yaml
```

## Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

### Install OLM

To install [Operator Lifecycle Manager] (OLM) run:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.20.0/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.20.0/olm.yaml
```

or

```
curl -L https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.20.3/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh v0.20.0
```

### Build the Catalog Image

The Starboard Operator metadata is formatted in *packagemanifest* layout, so you need to place it in the directory
structure of the [community-operators] repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:k8s-operatorhub/community-operators.git
cd community-operators
```

Build the catalog image for OLM containing just Starboard Operator with a Dockerfile like this:

```
cat << EOF > starboard.Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/operator-framework/upstream-registry-builder as builder

COPY operators/starboard-operator manifests
RUN /bin/initializer -o ./bundles.db

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/nsswitch.conf
COPY --from=builder /bundles.db /bundles.db
COPY --from=builder /bin/registry-server /registry-server
COPY --from=builder /bin/grpc_health_probe /bin/grpc_health_probe
EXPOSE 50051
ENTRYPOINT ["/registry-server"]
CMD ["--database", "bundles.db"]
EOF
```

Place the `starboard.Dockerfile` in the top-level directory of your cloned copy of the [community-operators] repository,
build it and push to a registry from where you can download it to your Kubernetes cluster:

```
docker image build -f starboard.Dockerfile -t docker.io/<your account>/starboard-catalog:dev .
docker image push docker.io/<your account>/starboard-catalog:dev
```

### Register the Catalog Image

Create a CatalogSource instance in the `olm` namespace to reference in the Operator catalog image that contains the
Starboard Operator:

```
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: starboard-catalog
  namespace: olm
spec:
  publisher: Starboard Maintainers
  displayName: Starboard Catalog
  sourceType: grpc
  image: docker.io/<your account>/starboard-catalog:dev
EOF
```

You can delete the default catalog that OLM ships with to avoid duplicate entries:

```
kubectl delete catalogsource operatorhubio-catalog -n olm
```

Inspect the list of loaded package manifests on the system with the following command to filter for the Starboard Operator:

```console
$ kubectl get packagemanifests
NAME                 CATALOG             AGE
starboard-operator   Starboard Catalog   97s
```

If the Starboard Operator appears in this list, the catalog was successfully parsed and it is now available to install.
Follow the installation instructions for [OLM][starboard-install-olm]. Make sure that the Subscription's `spec.source`
property refers to the `starboard-catalog` source instead of `operatorhubio-catalog`.
