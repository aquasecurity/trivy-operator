NSA, CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance v1.0 report will be generated every three hours by default.

The NSA compliance report is composed of two parts :

- `spec`: represents the NSA compliance control checks specification, check details, and the mapping to the security scanner

- `status`: represents the NSA compliance control checks results

Spec can be customized by amending the control checks `severity` or `cron` expression (report execution interval).
As an example, let's enter `vi` edit mode and change the `cron` expression.
```shell
kubectl edit compliance
```
Once the report has been generated, you can fetch and review its results section. As an example, let's fetch the compliance status report in JSON format

```shell
kubectl get compliance nsa  -o=jsonpath='{.status}' | jq .
```

If failures are found in the NSA report and additional investigation is required, you can fetch the nsa-details report for advance investigation.
As an example, let's fetch the report in JSON format
```shell
kubectl get compliancedetail nsa-details -o json
```
