# VulnerabilityReport

An instance of the VulnerabilityReport represents the latest vulnerabilities found in a container image of a given
Kubernetes workload. It consists of a list of OS package and application vulnerabilities with a summary of
vulnerabilities grouped by severity. For a multi-container workload trivy-operator creates multiple instances
of VulnerabilityReports in the workload's namespace with the owner reference set to that workload.
Each report follows the naming convention `<workload kind>-<workload name>-<container-name>`.

The following listing shows a sample VulnerabilityReport associated with the ReplicaSet named `nginx-6d4cf56db6` in the
`default` namespace that has the `nginx` container.

!!! note
    For various reasons we'll probably change the naming convention to name VulnerabilityReports by image digest (see [#288][issue-288]).

Any static vulnerability scanner that is compliant with the VulnerabilityReport schema can be integrated with trivy-operator.
You can find the list of available integrations [here](./../vulnerability-scanning/index.md).
