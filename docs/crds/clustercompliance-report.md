# ClusterComplianceReport

The ClusterComplianceReport is a cluster-scoped resource, which represents the latest compliance control checks results.
The report spec defines a mapping between pre-defined compliance control check ids to security scanners check ids.
Currently, only `config-audit` security scanners are supported.

The NSA compliance report is composed of two parts:

- `spec:` represents the compliance control checks specification, check details, and the mapping to the security scanner
  (this part is defined by the user)
- `status:` represents the compliance control checks (as defined by spec mapping) results extracted from the security
  scanners reports (this part is output by trivy-operator)

The following shows a sample ClusterComplianceReport NSA specification associated with the `cluster` in summary format:
