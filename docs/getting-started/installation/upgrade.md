# Upgrade

We recommend that you upgrade Trivy Operator often to stay up to date with the latest fixes and enhancements.

However, at this stage we do not provide automated upgrades. Therefore, uninstall the previous version of the operator
before you install the latest release.

!!! warning
    Consult release notes and changelog to revisit and migrate configuration settings which may not be compatible
    between different versions.
