# Kubernetes InfraAssessmentReport

An instance of the InfraAssessmentReport represents checks performed by [Trivy], 
against a Kubernetes infra core components (etcd,apiserver,scheduler,controller-manager and etc) setting and configuration.

The performed checks are based on the k8s [cis-benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes) controls and more.

For example, check that api-server `Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow`.

Each report is owned by the underlying Kubernetes object and is stored in the same namespace, following the
`<workload-kind>-<workload-name>` naming convention.

The following listing shows a sample InfraAssessmentReport associated with the Pod named `kube-apiserver-minikube` in the
`kube-system` namespace.
