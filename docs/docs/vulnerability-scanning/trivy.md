# Vulnerability Scanning Configuration

## Standalone

The default configuration settings enable Trivy `vulnerabilityReports.scanner` in [`Standalone`][trivy-standalone]
`trivy.mode`. Even though it doesn't require any additional setup, it's the least efficient method. Each Pod created
by a scan Job has the init container that downloads the Trivy vulnerabilities database from the GitHub releases page
and stores it in the local file system of the [emptyDir volume]. This volume is then shared with containers that perform
the actual scanning. Finally, the Pod is deleted along with the emptyDir volume.

The number of containers defined by a scan Job equals the number of containers defined by the scanned Kubernetes
workload, so the cache in this mode is useful only if the workload defines multiple containers.

Beyond that, frequent downloads from GitHub might lead to a [rate limiting] problem. The limits are imposed by GitHub on
all anonymous requests originating from a given IP. To mitigate such problems you can add the `trivy.githubToken` key to
the `trivy-operator` secret.

```bash

kubectl patch secret trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type merge \
  -p "$(cat <<EOF
{
  "data": {
    "trivy.githubToken": "$(echo -n <GITHUB_TOKEN> | base64)"
  }
}
EOF
)"
```

## ClientServer

You can connect Trivy to an external Trivy server by changing the default `trivy.mode` from
[`Standalone`][trivy-standalone] to [`ClientServer`][trivy-clientserver] and specifying `trivy.serverURL`.

```bash
kubectl patch cm trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type merge \
  -p "$(cat <<EOF
{
  "data": {
    "trivy.mode":      "ClientServer",
    "trivy.serverURL": "<TRIVY_SERVER_URL>"
  }
}
EOF
)"
```

The Trivy server could be your own deployment, or it could be an external service. See [Trivy server][trivy-clientserver] documentation for more information.

If the server requires access token and/or custom HTTP authentication headers, you may add `trivy.serverToken` and `trivy.serverCustomHeaders` properties to the Trivy Operator secret.

```bash
kubectl patch secret trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type merge \
  -p "$(cat <<EOF
{
  "data": {
    "trivy.serverToken":         "$(echo -n <SERVER_TOKEN> | base64)",
    "trivy.serverCustomHeaders": "$(echo -n x-api-token:<X_API_TOKEN> | base64)"
  }
}
EOF
)"
```
