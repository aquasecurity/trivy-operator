# Configuration

You can configure Trivy-Operator to control it's behavior and adapt it to your needs. Aspects of the operator machinery are configured using environment variables on the operator Pod, while aspects of the scanning behavior are controlled by ConfigMaps and Secrets.

The values of the `OPERATOR_NAMESPACE` and `OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES` determine the install mode, which in turn determines the multitenancy support of the operator.


| MODE| OPERATOR_NAMESPACE | OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES | DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|---|---|
| OwnNamespace| `operators`| `operators`| The operator can be configured to watch events in the namespace it is deployed in.                             |
| SingleNamespace| `operators`| `foo`| The operator can be configured to watch for events in a single namespace that the operator is not deployed in. |
| MultiNamespace| `operators`| `foo,bar,baz`| The operator can be configured to watch for events in more than one namespace.                                 |
| AllNamespaces| `operators`| (blank string)| The operator can be configured to watch for events in all namespaces.|

## Example - configure namespaces to scan

To change the target namespace from all namespaces to the `default` namespace edit the `trivy-operator` Deployment and change the value of the `OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES` environment variable from the blank string (`""`) to the `default` value.

Example: `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation": false, "capabilities": { "drop": ["ALL"]},"privileged": false, "readOnlyRootFilesystem": true }` |
| `report.resourceLabels`| N/A| One-line comma-separated representation of the scanned resource labels which the user wants to include in the Prometheus metrics report. Example: `owner,app,tier`|
| `metrics.resourceLabelsPrefix`| `k8s_label`| Prefix that will be prepended to the labels names indicated in `report.ResourceLabels` when including them in the Prometheus metrics|
|`report.recordFailedChecksOnly`| `"false"`| this flag is to record only failed checks on misconfiguration reports (config-audit and rbac assessment)
| `skipResourceByLabels`| N/A| One-line comma-separated labels keys which trivy-operator will skip scanning on resources with matching labels. Example: `test,transient`|

## Example - patch ConfigMap

By default Trivy displays vulnerabilities with all severity levels (`UNKNOWN`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`). To display only `HIGH` and `CRITICAL` vulnerabilities by patching the `trivy.severity` value in the `trivy-operator-trivy-config` ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl patch cm trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type merge \
  -p "$(cat <<EOF
{
  "data": {
    "trivy.severity": "HIGH,CRITICAL"
  }
}
EOF
)"
```

## Example - patch Secret

To set the GitHub token used by Trivy scanner add the `trivy.githubToken` value to the `trivy-operator-trivy-config` Secret:

```bash
kubectl patch secret trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type merge \
  -p "$(cat <<EOF
{
  "data": {
    "trivy.githubToken": "$(echo -n <your token> | base64)"
  }
}
EOF
)"
```

## Example - delete a key

The following `kubectl patch` command deletes the `trivy.httpProxy` key:

```bash
kubectl patch cm trivy-operator-trivy-config -n trivy-system \
  --type json \
  -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/data/trivy.httpProxy"}]'
```
