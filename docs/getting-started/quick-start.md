# Quick Start

## Before you Begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your
cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by installing [minikube], [kind] or [microk8s], or you can use the following [Kubernetes playground].

You also need the Trivy-Operator to be installed in the `trivy-system` namespace, e.g. with
[kubectl](./installation/kubectl.md) or [Helm](./installation/helm.md). Let's also assume that the operator is
configured to discover built-in Kubernetes resources in all namespaces, except `kube-system` and `trivy-system`.

## Workloads Scanning

Let's create the `nginx` Deployment that we know is vulnerable:

```
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx:1.16
```

When the `nginx` Deployment is created, the operator immediately detects its current revision (aka active ReplicaSet)
and scans the `nginx:1.16` image for vulnerabilities. It also audits the ReplicaSet's specification for common pitfalls
such as running the `nginx` container as root.

If everything goes fine, the operator saves scan reports as VulnerabilityReport and ConfigAuditReport resources in the
`default` namespace. Reports are named after the scanned ReplicaSet. For image vulnerability scans, the operator creates
a VulnerabilityReport for each different container. In this example there is just one container image called `nginx`:

```
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -o wide
```
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
NAME                                REPOSITORY      TAG    SCANNER   AGE   CRITICAL   HIGH   MEDIUM   LOW   UNKNOWN
replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4-nginx   library/nginx   1.16   Trivy     85s   33         62     49       114   1
```
</details>

```
kubectl get configauditreports -o wide
```
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
NAME                          SCANNER     AGE    CRITICAL  HIGH   MEDIUM   LOW
replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4   Trivy       2m7s      0         0      6        7
```
</details>

Notice that scan reports generated by the operator are controlled by Kubernetes workloads. In our example,
VulnerabilityReport and ConfigAuditReport resources are controlled by the active ReplicaSet of the `nginx` Deployment:

```console
kubectl tree deploy nginx
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
NAMESPACE  NAME                                                       READY  REASON  AGE
default    Deployment/nginx                                           -              7h2m
default    └─ReplicaSet/nginx-78449c65d4                              -              7h2m
default      ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4          -              2m31s
default      ├─Pod/nginx-78449c65d4-5wvdx                             True           7h2m
default      └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4-nginx  -              2m7s
```
</details>

!!! note
The [tree] command is a kubectl plugin to browse Kubernetes object hierarchies as a tree.

Moving forward, let's update the container image of the `nginx` Deployment from `nginx:1.16` to `nginx:1.17`. This will
trigger a rolling update of the Deployment and eventually create another ReplicaSet.

```
kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.17
```

Even this time the operator will pick up changes and rescan our Deployment with updated configuration:

```
kubectl tree deploy nginx
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
NAMESPACE  NAME                                                       READY  REASON  AGE
default    Deployment/nginx                                           -              7h5m
default    ├─ReplicaSet/nginx-5fbc65fff                               -              2m36s
default    │ ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff           -              2m36s
default    │ ├─Pod/nginx-5fbc65fff-j7zl2                              True           2m36s
default    │ └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff-nginx   -              2m22s
default    └─ReplicaSet/nginx-78449c65d4                              -              7h5m
default      ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4          -              5m46s
default      └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4-nginx  -              5m22s
```
</details>

By following this guide you could realize that the operator knows how to attach VulnerabilityReport and
ConfigAuditReport resources to build-in Kubernetes objects. What's more, in this approach where a custom resource
inherits a life cycle of the built-in resource we could leverage Kubernetes garbage collection. For example, when the
previous ReplicaSet named `nginx-78449c65d4` is deleted the VulnerabilityReport named `replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4-nginx`
as well as the ConfigAuditReport named `replicaset-nginx-78449c65d46` are automatically garbage collected.

!!! tip
If you do not want only the latest ReplicaSet in your Deployment to be scanned for vulnerabilities, you can set the value
of the `OPERATOR_VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_SCAN_ONLY_CURRENT_REVISIONS` environment variable to `false` in the operator's
deployment descriptor.

!!! tip
If you do not want only the latest ReplicaSet in your Deployment to be scanned for config audit, you can set the value
of the `OPERATOR_CONFIG_AUDIT_SCANNER_SCAN_ONLY_CURRENT_REVISIONS` environment variable to `false` in the operator's
deployment descriptor.

!!! tip
You can get and describe `vulnerabilityreports` and `configauditreports` as built-in Kubernetes objects:
```
kubectl get vulnerabilityreport replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff-nginx -o json
kubectl describe configauditreport replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff
```

Notice that scaling up the `nginx` Deployment will not schedule new scans because all replica Pods refer to the same Pod
template defined by the `nginx-5fbc65fff` ReplicaSet.

```
kubectl scale deploy nginx --replicas 3
```

```
kubectl tree deploy nginx
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
NAMESPACE  NAME                                                       READY  REASON  AGE
default    Deployment/nginx                                           -              7h6m
default    ├─ReplicaSet/nginx-5fbc65fff                               -              4m7s
default    │ ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff           -              4m7s
default    │ ├─Pod/nginx-5fbc65fff-458n7                              True           8s
default    │ ├─Pod/nginx-5fbc65fff-fk847                              True           8s
default    │ ├─Pod/nginx-5fbc65fff-j7zl2                              True           4m7s
default    │ └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-5fbc65fff-nginx   -              3m53s
default    └─ReplicaSet/nginx-78449c65d4                              -              7h6m
default      ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4          -              7m17s
default      └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-78449c65d4-nginx  -              6m53s
```
</details>

Finally, when you delete the `nginx` Deployment, orphaned security reports will be deleted in the background by the
Kubernetes garbage collection controller.

```
kubectl delete deploy nginx
```

```console
kubectl get vuln,configaudit
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
No resources found in default namespace.
```
</details>

!!! Tip
Use `vuln` and `configaudit` as short names for `vulnerabilityreports` and `configauditreports` resources.

!!! Note
The validity period for VulnerabilityReports by setting the duration as the value of the
`OPERATOR_SCANNER_REPORT_TTL` environment variable. The value is set to `24h` by default.

The reports wil be deleted after 24 hours. When a VulnerabilityReport gets deleted Trivy-Operator will automatically rescan the resource.



## What's Next?

- Find out how the operator scans workloads that use container images from [Private Registries].
- By default, the operator uses Trivy as [Vulnerability Scanner] and Polaris as [Configuration Checker], but you can
  choose other tools that are integrated with Trivy-Operator or even implement you own plugin.
