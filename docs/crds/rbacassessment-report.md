# RbacAssessmentReport

An instance of the RbacAssessmentReport represents checks performed by configuration auditing tools, such as [Trivy],
against a Kubernetes rbac assessment. For example, check that a given Role do not expose permission to secret for all groups

Each report is owned by the underlying Kubernetes object and is stored in the same namespace, following the
`<Role>-<role-name>` naming convention.

The following listing shows a sample RbacAssessmentReport associated with the Role named `role-868458b9d6` in the
`default` namespace.
