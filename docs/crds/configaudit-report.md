# ConfigAuditReport

An instance of the ConfigAuditReport represents checks performed by configuration auditing tools, such as [Trivy], 
against a Kubernetes object's configuration. For example, check that a given container image runs as
non-root user or that a container has resource requests and limits set. Checks might relate to Kubernetes workloads
and other namespaced Kubernetes objects such as Services, ConfigMaps, Roles, and RoleBindings.

Each report is owned by the underlying Kubernetes object and is stored in the same namespace, following the
`<workload-kind>-<workload-name>` naming convention.

The following listing shows a sample ConfigAuditReport associated with the ReplicaSet named `nginx-6d4cf56db6` in the
`default` namespace.

Third party Kubernetes configuration checkers, linters, and sanitizers that are compliant with the ConfigAuditReport
schema can be integrated with trivy-operator.

!!! note
    The challenge with onboarding third party configuration checkers is that they tend to have different interfaces
    to perform scans and vary in output formats for a relatively common goal, which is inspecting deployment descriptors
    for known configuration pitfalls.
