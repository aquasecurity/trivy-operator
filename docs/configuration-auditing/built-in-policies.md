# Built-in Configuration Audit Policies

The following sections list built-in configuration audit policies installed with trivy-operator. They are stored in the
`trivy-operator-policies-config` ConfigMap created in the installation namespace (e.g. `trivy-system`). You can modify
them or add a new policy. For example, follow the [Writing Custom Configuration Audit Policies] tutorial to add a custom
policy that checks for recommended Kubernetes labels on any resource kind.

| NAME                                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                         | KINDS    |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [CPU not limited]                          | Enforcing CPU limits prevents DoS via resource exhaustion.                                                                                                                                                          | Workload |
| [CPU requests not specified]               | When containers have resource requests specified, the scheduler can make better decisions about which nodes to place pods on, and how to deal with resource contention.                                             | Workload |
| [SYS_ADMIN capability added]               | SYS_ADMIN gives the processes running inside the container privileges that are equivalent to root.                                                                                                                  | Workload |
| [Default capabilities not dropped]         | The container should drop all default capabilities and add only those that are needed for its execution.                                                                                                            | Workload |
| [Root file system is not read-only]        | An immutable root file system prevents applications from writing to their local disk. This can limit intrusions, as attackers will not be able to tamper with the file system or write foreign executables to disk. | Workload |
| [Memory not limited]                       | Enforcing memory limits prevents DoS via resource exhaustion.                                                                                                                                                       | Workload |
| [Memory requests not specified]            | When containers have memory requests specified, the scheduler can make better decisions about which nodes to place pods on, and how to deal with resource contention.                                               | Workload |
| [hostPath volume mounted with docker.sock] | Mounting docker.sock from the host can give the container full root access to the host.                                                                                                                             | Workload |
| [Runs with low group ID]                   | Force the container to run with group ID > 10000 to avoid conflicts with the host’s user table.                                                                                                                     | Workload |
| [Runs with low user ID]                    | Force the container to run with user ID > 10000 to avoid conflicts with the host’s user table.                                                                                                                      | Workload |
| [Tiller Is Deployed]                       | Check if Helm Tiller component is deployed.                                                                                                                                                                         | Workload |
| [Image tag ':latest' used]                 | It is best to avoid using the ':latest' image tag when deploying containers in production. Doing so makes it hard to track which version of the image is running, and hard to roll back the version.                | Workload |

| [Unused capabilities should be dropped (drop any)]             | Security best practices require containers to run with minimal required capabilities.                                                    | Workload      |

| [All container images must start with the *.azurecr.io domain] | Containers should only use images from trusted registries.                                                                               | Workload      |

| [Access to host network]           | Sharing the host’s network namespace permits processes in the pod to communicate with processes bound to the host’s loopback adapter.                                                                                                                                                    | Workload |
| [Access to host PID]               | Sharing the host’s PID namespace allows visibility on host processes, potentially leaking information such as environment variables and configuration.                                                                                                                                   | Workload |

| [Unsafe sysctl options set]        | Sysctls can disable security mechanisms or affect all containers on a host, and should be disallowed except for an allowed 'safe' subset. A sysctl is considered safe if it is namespaced in the container or the Pod, and it is isolated from other Pods or processes on the same Node. | Workload |
