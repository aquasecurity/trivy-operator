# Writing Custom Configuration Audit Policies

trivy-operator ships with a set of [Built-in Configuration Audit Policies] defined as OPA [Rego] policies. You can also
define custom policies and associate them with applicable Kubernetes resources to extend basic configuration audit
functionality.

This tutorial will walk through the process of creating and testing a new configuration audit policy that fails whenever
a Kubernetes resource doesn't specify `app.kubernetes.io/name` or `app.kubernetes.io/version` labels.

## Writing a Policy

To define such a policy, you must first define its metadata. This includes setting a unique identifier, title, severity
(`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`), descriptive text, and remediation steps. In Rego it's defined as the
`__rego_metadata__` rule, which defines the following composite value:

```opa
package trivyoperator.policy.k8s.custom

import data.lib.result
import future.keywords.in

__rego_metadata__ := {
    "id": "recommended_labels",
    "title": "Recommended labels",
    "severity": "LOW",
    "type": "Kubernetes Security Check",
    "description": "A common set of labels allows tools to work interoperably, describing objects in a common manner that all tools can understand.",
    "recommended_actions": "Take full advantage of using recommended labels and apply them on every resource object.",
    "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/",
}
```

Note that the `recommended_labels` policy in scoped to the `trivyoperator.policy.k8s.custom` package to avoid naming
collision with built-in policies that are pre-installed with trivy-operator.

Once we've got our metadata defined, we need to create the logic of the policy, which is done in the `deny` or `warn`
rule.

```opa

__rego_input__ := {
	"combine": false,
	"selector": [{"type": "kubernetes"}],
}

deny[res] {
	input.kind == "Pod"
	some container in input.spec.containers
	not startswith(container.image, "hooli.com")
	msg := sprintf("Image '%v' comes from untrusted registry", [container.image])
	res := result.new(msg, container)
}
```

These matches are essentially Rego assertions, so anyone familiar with writing rules for OPA or other tools that use
Rego should find the process familiar. In this case, itâ€™s pretty straightforward. We subtract the set of labels
specified by the `input` resource object from the set of recommended labels. The resulting set is stored in the variable
called `missing`. Finally, we check if the `missing` set is empty. If not, the `deny` rule fails with the appropriate
message.

The `input` document is set by trivy-operator to a Kubernetes resource when the policy is evaluated. For pods, it would look
something like the following listing:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "Pod",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "nginx",
    "labels": {
      "run": "nginx"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "containers": [
      {
        "name": "nginx",
        "image": "nginx:1.16",
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The labels set on the pod resource above can be retrieved with the following Rego expression:

```opa
provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
```

You can find the complete Rego code listing in [recommended_labels.rego](./recommended_labels.rego).

## Testing a Policy

Now that you've created the policy, you need to test it to make sure it works as intended. To do that, add policy code to
the `trivy-operator-policies-config` ConfigMap and associate it with any (`*`) Kubernetes resource kind:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: trivy-operator-policies-config
  namespace: trivy-system
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: trivy-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: trivy-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "{{ git.tag[1:] }}"
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubectl
data:
  policy.recommended_labels.kinds: "*"
  policy.recommended_labels.rego: |
  package trivyoperator.policy.k8s.custom

   import data.lib.result
   import future.keywords.in

   __rego_metadata__ := {
      "id": "recommended_labels",
      "title": "Recommended labels",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "type": "Kubernetes Security Check",
      "description": "A common set of labels allows tools to work interoperably, describing objects in a common manner that all tools can understand.",
      "recommended_actions": "Take full advantage of using recommended labels and apply them on every resource object.",
      "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/",
  }

   __rego_input__ := {
      "combine": false,
      "selector": [{"type": "kubernetes"}],
  }

   deny[res] {
      input.kind == "Pod"
      some container in input.spec.containers
      not startswith(container.image, "hooli.com")
      msg := sprintf("Image '%v' comes from untrusted registry", [container.image])
      res := result.new(msg, container)
  }
```

In this example, to add a new policy, you must define two data entries in the `trivy-operator-policies-config`
ConfigMap:

1. The `policy.<your_policy_name>.kinds` entry is used to designate applicable Kubernetes resources as a comma separated
   list of Kubernetes kinds (e.g., `Pod,ConfigMap,NetworkPolicy`). There is also a special value (`Workload`) that you
   can use to select all Kubernetes workloads, and (`*`) to select all Kubernetes resources recognized by trivy-operator.
2. The `policy.<your_policy_name>.rego` entry holds the policy Rego code.

trivy-operator automatically detects policies added to the `trivy-operator-policies-config` ConfigMap and immediately rescans
applicable Kubernetes resources.

Let's create the `test` ConfigMap without recommended labels:

```console
$ kubectl create cm test --from-literal=foo=bar
configmap/test created
```

When you retrieve the corresponding configuration audit report, you'll see that there is one check with `LOW` severity
that's failing:

```console
$ kubectl get configauditreport configmap-test -o wide
NAME             SCANNER     AGE   CRITICAL  HIGH   MEDIUM   LOW
configmap-test   trivy-operator   24s   0         0      0        1
```

If you describe the report you'll see that it's failing because of our custom policy:

``` { .yaml .annotate }
apiVersion: aquasecurity.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: ConfigAuditReport
metadata:
  labels:
    trivy-operator.resource.kind: ConfigMap
    trivy-operator.resource.name: test
    trivy-operator.resource.namespace: default
    plugin-config-hash: df767ff5f
    resource-spec-hash: 7c96769cf
  name: configmap-test
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: v1
    blockOwnerDeletion: false
    controller: true
    kind: ConfigMap
    name: test
report:
  scanner:
    name: trivy-operator
    vendor: Aqua Security
    version: {{ git.tag }}
  summary:
    criticalCount: 0
    highCount: 0
    lowCount: 1
    mediumCount: 0
  checks:
  - checkID: recommended_labels  # (1)
    title: Recommended labels    # (2)
    severity: LOW                # (3)
    category: Kubernetes Security Check  # (4)
    description: |                       # (5)
      A common set of labels allows tools to work interoperably,
      describing objects in a common manner that all tools can
      understand.
    success: false  # (6)
    messages:       # (7)
    - 'You must provide labels: {"app.kubernetes.io/name", "app.kubernetes.io/version"}'
```

1. The `checkID` property corresponds to the policy identifier, i.e. `__rego_meatadata__.id`.
2. The `title` property as defined by the policy metadata in `__rego_metadata__.title`.
3. The `severity` property as defined by the policy metadata in `__rego_metadata__.severity`.
4. The `category` property as defined by the policy metadata in `__rego_metadata__.type`.
5. The `description` property as defined by the policy metadata in `__rego_metadata__.description`.
6. The flag indicating whether the configuration audit check has failed or passed.
7. The array of messages with details in case of failure.
