# Webhook Integration

Trivy Operator allows you to send reports externally to a webhook as they get produced. This is useful in cases where you would like to _"set-and-forget"_ the operator and monitor the reports elsewhere. It's also useful when you have to make decisions based on a report, e.g. prune a vulnerable image, remove a deployment with exposed secrets etc.

The latter use case can be fulfilled by using a SOAR tool [Postee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/postee). Out of the box, Postee offers a variety of integrations with other third party services such as ServiceNow, Slack, AWS Security Hub and many more.

You can enable the Webhook integration as follows:

1. Required: Set `OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_BROADCAST_URL` to the webhook endpoint you'd like to send the reports to.
2. Optional: Set `OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_BROADCAST_TIMEOUT` to a time limit that suites your use case. Default is `30s`.

The Webhook integration is only able to send `vulnerabilityreport` and `exposedsecretreport` type of reports.
