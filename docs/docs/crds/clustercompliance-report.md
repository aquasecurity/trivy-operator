# ClusterComplianceReport

The ClusterComplianceReport is a cluster-scoped resource, which represents the latest compliance control check results.
The report spec defines a mapping between pre-defined compliance control check ids to security scanners check ids.
Currently, only `config-audit` security scanners are supported.

## Built in reports

The following reports are available out of the box:

| Compliance | Name for command | More info
--- | --- | ---
NSA, CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance v1.2 | `nsa` | [Link](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Aug/29/2003066362/-1/-1/0/CTR_KUBERNETES_HARDENING_GUIDANCE_1.2_20220829.PDF)
CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes v1.23 | `cis` | [Link](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes)

### The compliance report structure

- `spec:` represents the compliance control checks specification, check details, and the mapping to the security scanner
  (this part is defined by the user)
- `status:` represents the compliance control checks (as defined by spec mapping) results extracted from the security
  scanners reports (this part is output by trivy-operator)

The following shows a sample ClusterComplianceReport NSA specification associated with the `cluster` in summary format:
